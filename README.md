# vim-codequery
  
This Vim plugin is built on top of the great tool [CodeQuery](https://github.com/ruben2020/codequery) created by ruben2020, and aims at providing three primary functions to help you to:
  
1. **Search source code gracefully within Vim**.
    * You can find: `definition, call, caller, callee, symbol, class, parent, child` and more for a string.
    * Well-formated results are shown in a custom Quickfix window with usable key bindings.
2. **Manage your database easily**.
    * Load, make and move your database file by custom Vim commands.
    * `Note: CodeQuery's SQLite database is built on top of ctags and cscope.`
3. **Know your code more instantly**.
    * (TBD)
  
##  Supported languages
  * [X] `Python` (in beta: **give it a try! ðŸ˜Ž**)
  * [ ] `Javascript` (coming soon)
  * [ ] `Ruby` (coming soon)
  * [ ] `Go` (coming soon)
  * [ ] `Java` (coming later)
  * [ ] `C, C++` (coming very later)
